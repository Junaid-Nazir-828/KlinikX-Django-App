        <h3 class="mt-4 text-klinkx">Intrauterine Insemination (IUI): Assisted Reproductive Technology</h3>
        <p>
          Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a type of fertility treatment that involves directly injecting sperm into a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilization. The aim of IUI is to increase the number of sperm that reach the fallopian tubes and subsequently enhance the chance of fertilization.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-3 text-klinkx">Indications for IUI</h4>
        <p>
          IUI is often recommended for couples who have unexplained infertility, mild male factor infertility, or women with cervical mucus problems. It's also a choice for single women or same-sex couples using donor sperm to conceive

    <h4 class="mt-3 text-klinkx">Preparation for IUI</h4>
    <p>Before the procedure, women might take fertility drugs to stimulate ovulation and increase the number of mature eggs. Ovulation is then monitored through blood tests and ultrasound to determine the best time for insemination.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 text-klinkx">IUI Procedure</h4>
        <p>IUI is a quick procedure that involves a catheter to deliver the prepared sperm directly into the uterus. This procedure is usually painless, although some women may experience mild cramping.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-3 text-klinkx">After the Procedure and Success Rates</h4>
    <p>After IUI, women can typically return to normal activities immediately. Some may experience light spotting for a day or two. A pregnancy test is usually performed about two weeks after the procedure.</p>
    <p>The success of IUI depends on several factors, including age, overall fertility health, and whether fertility drugs were used. Generally, the pregnancy rate for IUI ranges from 10-20% per cycle.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-3 text-klinkx">Risks and Complications</h4>
    <p>The risks of IUI are relatively low. Some potential complications include infection, spotting, and multiple pregnancies. If fertility drugs are used, there is also a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.</p>
